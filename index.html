                    Objectives
                </h3>
                <p>
                The application of sophisticated analysis tools to fetal, neonatal and paediatric imaging data is of interest to a substantial proportion of the MICCAI community. It has gained additional interest especially in recent years, with the successful large scale open data initiatives such as the developing Human Connectome Project, the Baby Connectome Project, and the NIH-funded Human Placenta Project. These projects enable researchers without access to perinatal scanning facilities to bring in their image analysis expertise and domain knowledge.
                Advanced medical image analysis allows the detailed scientific study of conditions such as prematurity and the study of both normal singleton and twin development in addition to less common conditions unique to childhood.
                This workshop will complement the main MICCAI conference by providing a focused discussion of perinatal and paediatric image analysis that is not possible within the main conference.

                <i>The protracted maturation and evolutionary expansion of the brain is a prerequisite for our intellectual capacity, and many of our highly developed cognitive abilities are linked to features that are unique to humans. However, our current understanding of neurodevelopment is based on translating results from post mortem studies, animal experiments or studies on prematurely born neonates, which limits our understanding of possible human-specific aspects of development. The talk will give an overview of recent developments and trends in the in vivo, in utero imaging of human neurodevelopment and demonstrate how novel imaging modalities have shaped basic and clinical research and therapeutic follow-up.

                    Andras Jakab is a junior group leader at the Neuroscience Centre Zürich and research associate at the University Children’s Hospital in Zürich, Switzerland. His research interests are clinical neuroimaging, connectomic imaging and medical image processing. He completed his medical and PhD studies in Hungary, and has worked, among other institutions, at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zürich and at the Medical University of Vienna. In Zürich, he spearheaded an initiative to establish an image analysis platform that supports exciting research projects in the field of early human brain development.
